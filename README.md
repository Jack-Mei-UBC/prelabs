# prelabs
Merging prelabs because im too lazy to do it anymore

1. Download everything here, place it in the same folder, and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" 

2. Place all lab marks, along with the class list and prelab marks in a folder called "files" in the directory

3. labnumber (line 21) is the sheet number of the lab (first sheet is 0, L20), must be xlsx

4. Must be formatted in the way where the TA marksheets start with lab (case sensitive), must be xlsx

5. Prelabs must start with Lab, must be csv (same as other Jack's tool)

6. Class list must start with cpsc_121, must be csv (same as other Jack's tool)
