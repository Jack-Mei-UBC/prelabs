# prelabs
Merging prelabs because im too lazy to do it anymore
Basically how this works, is you drag all the required files into a directory called "files"


# Place all lab marks, along with the class list and prelab marks in a folder called "files" in the directory
# labnumber is the sheet number of the lab (first sheet is 0, L20), must be xlsx
# Must be formatted in the way where the TA marksheets start with lab (case sensitive), must be xlsx
# Prelabs must start with Lab, must be csv
# Class list must start with cpsc_121, must be csv
